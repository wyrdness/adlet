      "full": "Adlet are dog-human hybrid creatures from Inuit mythology. In most versions, they have the lower body of a dog and upper body of a human, though some variants reverse this arrangement. According to Inuit creation myths, the Adlet originated when a woman married a dog, and their offspring were these half-dog children. The Adlet are described as fierce warriors who live separately from humans. In some Inuit traditions, the Adlet are considered ancestors of both their own race and Europeans, serving as an origin myth that explains the existence of other peoples. The creature represents themes of transformation and the boundary between human and animal, serving as a cautionary tale about proper social boundaries while also functioning as a creation mythology."
