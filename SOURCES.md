## Cultural Sensitivity Statement

This documentation is based on publicly available sources about Inuit creation mythology. We recognize that:

- Inuit creation myths are sacred knowledge and intellectual property of Inuit peoples
- The Adlet story is cosmological, explaining origins of peoples and cultural identity
- This is not merely folklore or fantasy, but fundamental cultural and spiritual knowledge
- Origin stories deserve the same respect as any sacred religious text

Researchers and readers should:

- Consult with Inuit communities for proper cultural context
- Respect the cosmological and spiritual significance of creation myths
- Avoid treating as merely entertainment or fantasy creatures
- Recognize this as living cultural and spiritual tradition
- Follow OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
- Understand the deep function of explaining human origins and relationships

The Adlet story addresses fundamental questions about:
- Origins of different peoples
- Human identity and boundaries
- Cultural identity and "otherness"
- Human-animal relationships
- Social norms and taboos
- Cosmological order

This sacred knowledge deserves respect commensurate with any world religion's creation mythology.
